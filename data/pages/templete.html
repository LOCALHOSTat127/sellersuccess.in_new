        To Start a company in India and Investing was never so easy, cheap and quick. One can start a wholly owned Indian subsidiary anywhere in India. There are no state-specific laws. There’s only one central law that governs Indian Subsidiary Set up across India. All you need a resident Indian director (not necessarily a shareholder but can be an employee!) and a rented (virtual) place of office to get going. 100% ownership, strategic decision making and control of operations rest with your parent company at all times.

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Choose the Type of Entity: Determine the type of entity you want to register. Foreigners commonly choose between a private limited company or a limited liability partnership (LLP) for their business in India. Each structure has its own requirements and benefits.</li>
            <li>Obtain Digital Signature Certificate (DSC): Before initiating the registration process, at least one director of the proposed company must obtain a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC). The DSC is required for filing online documents with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).</li>
            <li>Apply for Director Identification Number (DIN): Each director of the proposed company must obtain a Director Identification Number (DIN). This unique identification number is mandatory for all existing and potential directors of a company in India.</li>
            <li>Register for a Unique Name (RUN): Choose a unique name for your company and submit it for approval through the Reserve Unique Name (RUN) service provided by the MCA. Ensure the proposed name complies with naming guidelines and is not identical or similar to existing company names.</li>
            <li>Drafting of Incorporation Documents: Prepare the necessary incorporation documents, including the Memorandum of Association (MoA) and Articles of Association (AoA) for a private limited company, or LLP agreement for an LLP. These documents outline the company’s objectives, rules, and regulations.</li>
