However, the concept of HUF is specific to Indian law and may not have equivalents in other legal systems.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">The family continues to exist even after the death of the common ancestor and the next eldest male member becomes the head of the family or the “Karta”. In financial terms, we can call him ‘manager of the family’. Even on the death of all the male members, the HUF continues to exist.</p><div class=\"list_container\"><p class=\"section-title\">Conditions to be fulfilled to create an HUF :</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>HUF should only be formed by a family.</li><li>HUF is automatically created for newly added member of the family at the time of their marriage.</li><li>HUF in general consists of a common anscentor and all of his descentors including their dughters and wives,</li><li>Buddhists, Jains, Hindus and sikhs are able to form HUF.</li><li>HUF often has assets which come as will, gift or ancentral property,</li><li>Once the HUF is created, the bank account should be created in the name of the HUF.
